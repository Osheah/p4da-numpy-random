## Getting Started
First get the required software
As I have windows 10 on my pc I'm only adding links to this version of various software. 

### Prerequisites
This project requires jupyter notebook, python, and for convience cmder. It also requires a github account. 
Anaconda has python, ipython, jupyter notebook and a large number of common python packages required in Data Analysis. 
1. Get anaconda 3.7 version for windows [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. get git 2.19.1 [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
3. optional get cmder 1.3.6[cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.6/cmder.zip) (this comes with git so you can drop option 2 above if you go with option 3.  
4. set up github account and create a repo [github](https://github.com/)


### Installing

Install the above packages. Any problems google it. update any packages; from cmder 
```
conda update â€“all 
git - version
```

## Repository structure

The gitignore file ignores the .git and .ipynb_checkpoints in the local folder. Python files are also ignored. A standard gitignore file was used. It can be found here [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) 

* data 
    * ANSURD2Distribution.zip which can be downloaded  at this link [Ansurd2](http://mreed.umtri.umich.edu/mreed/downloads.html)contaning public data on us military personale heights from 2012 - used to illustrate normal distribution. 
    One file is unzipped and the spaces in the name removed ANSURIIMALEPublic.csv
* img - various images used within the report; this may change so I'll not list them out. some i made up some were taken from the internet, some have acknowledgements added in the jupyter notebook.
* .gitignore - gitignore file taken from [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)
* License - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3
* README.md - this readme
* numpy-random.ipynb - The main body of the assignment
* numpy-ref-1.15.1.pdf - taken from [numpybook](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/_static/numpybook.pdf)
* numpybook.pdf - taken from [numpy reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/numpy-ref-1.15.1.pdf)


I may or may not remove the book links by the time the assignment is due; same with some of the photos. 

## Jupyter 

The main body of work is in the jupyter notebook numpy-random.ipynb. 

### Running a Jupyter notebook

#### Start jupyter notebook
2 way's via the anaconda app or via the command line on cmder. I will describe the cmder approach.
open cmder in home directory or from a folder within the home directory
```
C:\Users\Helen\Desktop\GMIT\github\
```
Create a repo on github [repo](https://github.com/Osheah/p4da-numpy-random)
clone the repo on github by clicking the green clone or download link
in cmder
```
git clone https://github.com/Osheah/p4da-numpy-random.git
git init
```
open jupyter using the command
```
jupyter notebook
```
A browser should open linking the current directory in cmder to an jupyter version of windows explorer its  home page.

http://localhost:8888/tree

### create a jupyter notebook
navigate to your cloned folder from within the jupyter explorer. On the right theres a button 'new' click this and select python 3. A new jupyter notebook will open with the default title untitled. click on the name 'untitled' and rename it numpy-random.ipynb. Details on how to create cells in jupyter notebook can be found here [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#basic-workflow). Save any work (although it is usually saved automatically). 

### ending a jupyter notebook session
Save your unsaved jupyter notebooks. Close jupyter in your browser. Go to cmder and enter **control + c**. This shuts the ipython kernal that jupyter uses. upload your notebook to github via the commands below; make sure that you are in the directory that git is initialised in e.g. C:\Users\Helen\Desktop\GMIT\github\p4da-numpy-random\
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "add a relivent commit message"
git push
```
### opening a jupyter notebook

jupyter notebooks have the extension ipynb. When you find a notebook that you want to look at or edit, dont click on it; instead right click and save it to your local pc. Then open jupyter notebook via the cmder command and navigate to the notebook. NB; before opening the notebook make sure the notebook is saved in a sub directory of the cmder path. jupyter notebooks cannot access any files that are not within the path when the kernal is called.
