## Getting Started

First get the required software, as I have windows 10 on my pc I'm only adding links to this version of various software. 

### Prerequisites

This project requires

    * Jupyter notebook
    * iPython via Anaconda and other python packages like  numpy
    * cmder 
    * Github account
    
Anaconda has python, ipython, jupyter notebook and a large number of common python packages required in Data Analysis. 

    1. Get anaconda 3.7 version for windows [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
    2. Get git 2.19.1 [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    3. Get cmder 1.3.6 [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.6/cmder.zip) - Optional (cmder comes with git so you can drop option 2 above if you go with option 3).  
    4. Get github account - set up github account and create a repo [Github](https://github.com/)


### Installing

Install the above packages. Any problems google it. Update any packages; From cmder type... 

```
conda update â€“all 
git - version
```

## Repository structure

The gitignore file ignores the .git and .ipynb_checkpoints in the local folder. Python files are also ignored. A standard gitignore file was used. It can be found here [Python gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) 

    * data 
        * ANSURD2Distribution.zip which can be downloaded  at this link [Ansurd2](http://mreed.umtri.umich.edu/mreed/downloads.html)contaning public data on us military personale heights from 2012 - used to illustrate normal distribution. 
    One file is unzipped and the spaces in the name removed ANSURIIMALEPublic.csv
    * img - various images used within the report; this may change so I'll not list them out. some i made up some were taken from the internet, some have acknowledgements added in the jupyter notebook.
    * .gitignore - gitignore file taken from [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)
    * License - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3
    * README.md - this readme
    * numpy-random.ipynb - The main body of the assignment
    * numpy-ref-1.15.1.pdf - taken from [numpybook](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/_static/numpybook.pdf)
    * numpybook.pdf - taken from [numpy reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/numpy-ref-1.15.1.pdf)


I may or may not remove the book links by the time the assignment is due; same with some of the photos. 

## Jupyter 

The main body of work is in the jupyter notebook *numpy-random.ipynb*. 


### Running a Jupyter notebook


#### Start jupyter notebook

There are two ways to start jupyter notebook. 

    1. Via the Anaconda App 
    2. Via the command line on cmder. 

I will describe the cmder approach.


Open cmder in your home directory or from a folder within the home directory. Jupyter notebook will only be able to access this folder and any sub folders. 
```
C:\Users\Helen\Desktop\GMIT\github\
```
    * Create a repo on github [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Osheah/p4da-numpy-random)
    * Clone the repo on github by clicking the green clone or download link
    
Go to cmder and enter ...

```
git clone https://github.com/Osheah/p4da-numpy-random.git
git init
```
Open jupyter using the command...

```
jupyter notebook

```
A browser should open linking the current directory in cmder to an jupyter version of windows explorer. Jupyter notebook will open at its home page http://localhost:8888/tree


### create a jupyter notebook

Navigate to your cloned folder from within the Jupyter notebook home. On the right click the 'new' button and select python 3. A new jupyter notebook for python 3 will open with the default title *untitled*. Click on the name *untitled* and rename it e.g. numpy-random.ipynb. Details on how to create cells in jupyter notebook can be found here [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#basic-workflow). Save any work (although it is usually saved automatically). 

### ending a jupyter notebook session

Save any unsaved jupyter notebooks. Close jupyter notebook windows in your browser. Go to cmder and enter **control + c**. This shuts the ipython kernal that jupyter uses. Upload your notebook to github via the commands below; Make sure that you are in the directory that git is initialised in e.g. C:\Users\Helen\Desktop\GMIT\github\p4da-numpy-random\

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "add a relivent commit message"
git push
```

### opening a jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebooks have the extension ipynb. When you find a notebook that you want to look at or edit, dont click on it; Instead right click and save it to your local pc. Then open jupyter notebook via the cmder commandline and navigate to the notebook. NB; **before opening the notebook make sure the notebook is saved in a sub directory of the cmder path**. Jupyter notebooks cannot access any files that are not within the path when the kernal is called.
